# Briefly describe Trashed

Think about those single-use items like plastic bottles or cans. You know, the ones we use once and then toss away? Well, they have a way of gathering in places with fewer people or in the water where fish and other creatures live. It's like they disappear from our sight, but they're causing trouble in these far-off places. Now, because we don't always see where these items end up, it's tough for us to grasp just how many of them there are and how much harm they do. The disconnect between where these items are made and the pollution they cause makes it tricky to get everyone excited about changing how we use them.

But imagine if we could connect the dots and get an idea of how many of these pollutants are out there. Seeing their impact on a human scale could make us more sensitive to our environment over time, encouraging us to be mindful of our choices and use fewer of these in our everyday tasks. 

TRASHED stands out as an inventive augmented reality app that allows users get a sense of how much space disposable items occupy and how they can choke an environment making it difficult to navigate and live in. Utilizing augmented reality technology, the app superimposes holographic representations of various single-use pollutants, such as plastic, glass, food, or aluminium disposables, offering users a distinctive and immersive means to witness the accumulation of pollutants in their immediate surroundings.

Users can interact with the app by voicing specific queries like, "Show me the amount of glass bottles thrown away in my city." In response, TRASHED generates 3D holographic images of the selected pollutant within the user's surroundings. This not only provides a visually engaging experience but also allows to explore and understand the extent and number of different types of pollutants thrown away.

What sets TRASHED apart is its educational aspect. Users can access detailed information about each pollutant, including its impact, composition, and potential consequences. This combination of interactivity and information makes TRASHED not just an app but a compelling tool for raising awareness and fostering a deeper understanding of the environmental impact of various pollutants.

TRASHED is a wake-up call to change our habits. Picture a world where our convenience doesn't cost the environment. Join us on a playful journey towards a cleaner, greener future. Let's trash the pollution problem together!

## Facts

- Plastic Disposables

Americans throw away <color=green>695</color> plastic bottles per second and 2.5 million plastic bottles every hour. 8 million pieces of plastic pollution make their way into the ocean every day. 100,000 marine mammals and turtles and 1 million sea birds are killed by marine plastic pollution every year. A plastic bottle can last for 450 years in the ocean and it never truly disappears. 

- Glass Disposables

Americans throw away <color=green>887</color> glass bottles per second! More than 28 billion glass bottles and jars end up in landfills every year — that is the equivalent of filling up two Empire State Buildings every three weeks. The average time for a glass bottle to decompose is around 4,000 years.

- Food Waste

Americans discard more food than any other country, nearly 40 million tons per year, that is equivalent to<color=green>650</color> food items per second! That’s estimated to be almost 40 percent of the entire US food supply and equates to 325 pounds of waste per person. That’s like every person in America throwing 975 apples per year right into the garbage! One-third of all food produced in the world – approximately 1.3 billion tonnes – is lost or wasted every year.

- Aluminum Disposables

The total aluminum waste production is about 400 million tons and that is equivalent to roughly <color=green>1936</color> cans per second. If an aluminium can goes to landfill, it will stay there for 500 years before it oxidises. Close to 70% of all aluminium drinks cans are recycled globally. Recycling one aluminium can save enough energy to run a TV for three hours.
